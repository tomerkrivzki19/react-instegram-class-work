H.W 25/06:
1) React context API is being used mostly to store/share data between components, and avoid the props providing every time
See example from class: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usecontext.asp
Use the React Context API in your instagram app to store the posts data
1.1) Create another instagram page, that presents the TOP 3 posts according to their date (latest posts - add dates for each post if needed), use the useContext to retrieve the data from the context
--------------------- from here
2) Use useRef hook in order to interact with a dom element - create an event listener on a button in the new page you create, the button is "Create a post" 
on clicking the button - perform redirect to the first page.
3) In our previous HWs we defined callback funcs that return function according to an input.
    Use React useCallBack hook for this same case to use the same callback and not re-render this - only if the provided value changed.
4) Read about JS promises here -
